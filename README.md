## About SokjeTech

<a href="https://sokje.tech">SokjeTech</a> is an online RNG- and text-based racing simulation platform. Users are able
to create entire universes filled with either fantasy or real teams and drivers, from any era, and configure the racing
calendar to their liking. The simulation of races can be completely configured as well, like RNG ranges, DNF reasons,
qualifying formats, etc.

The project is currently in the closed alpha stage while it's still under (early) active development. For any questions,
suggestions or other remarks, contact lolsokje#0666 on Discord.
