    <h3>Seasons</h3>

    <p>
        Seasons are perhaps the most important part of SokjeTech, as they are where you actually build your sim. Within
        a season you'll define a
        <InertiaLink :href="route('tutorials', 'calendar')">calender</InertiaLink>
        (including stints and their RNG for each race),
        <InertiaLink :href="route('tutorials', 'entrants')">teams</InertiaLink>
        and their
        <InertiaLink :href="route('tutorials', 'racers')">drivers</InertiaLink>
        and finally
        <InertiaLink :href="route('tutorials', 'configurations')">configurations</InertiaLink>
        for things like the point system, qualifying format and reliability.
